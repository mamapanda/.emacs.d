* Emacs
** ~use-package~ Keyword Order
~use-package~'s keywords should be specified in the following
order. Some will come from other packages.
| Type              | Keyword        |
|-------------------+----------------|
| Enable            | ~:disabled~    |
|                   | ~:if~          |
|                   | ~:when~        |
| Install           | ~:ensure~      |
|                   | ~:quelpa~      |
| Load Order        | ~:after~       |
|                   | ~:defer~       |
|                   | ~:demand~      |
| Association       | ~:mode~        |
|                   | ~:interpreter~ |
| Explicit Autoload | ~:commands~    |
| Hook              | ~:hook~        |
|                   | ~:ghook~       |
|                   | ~:gfhook~      |
| Keybinding        | ~:bind~        |
|                   | ~:general~     |
| Configuration     | ~:init~        |
|                   | ~:config~      |

** Mode-specific Mapping Conventions
The keys may be either single keys or prefixes, all bound behind a
common prefix key (~SPC ;~ as of writing). Unmentioned keys are
free to be bound to anything. Also, it's okay to ignore a mapping
convention when it doesn't make sense (e.g. ~c~ as compile in
~dired-mode~).

| Key | Description     |
|-----+-----------------|
| ~c~ | compile         |
| ~d~ | debug           |
| ~e~ | list errors     |
| ~i~ | imenu           |
| ~j~ | next error      |
| ~k~ | previous error  |
| ~r~ | rename          |
| ~R~ | refactor        |
| ~t~ | test            |
| ~x~ | find references |
| ~,~ | repl            |
| ~\~ | restart server  |

* i3
The XKB keyboard options may have to be added to
~/etc/X11/mhwd.d/intel.conf~ to persist after a suspend. Making a
systemd resume unit doesn't seem to work.
